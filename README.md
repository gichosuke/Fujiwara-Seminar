# Fujiwara-Seminar
This repository is mainly for the students of Fujiwara Seminar.
I use this to share the code I used in my seminar activities, after excluding personal information.
Some of my other repositories are open to the public for my own research, but I'd appreciate it if you didn't look at them.
